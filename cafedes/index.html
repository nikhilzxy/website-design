        	<h1>Welcome to Epic Cafe.</h1>
            <p>Since 2017, Café Epic has been one of Kathmandu’s favourite eateries. This intimate café offers a refreshingly accomplished cosmopolitan cuisine without being yet another copycat con-fusion restaurant. It also has a sophisticated range of coffee , pastries , cakes and muffines on its well chosen menu.Cafe Epic has four guestrooms to allow you the luxury to process your sometimes overwhelming local experiences in comfort, perhaps even style.It is almost anti-tourism as one feels this place will be as it is with or without us! The place is more important than anything else. If it is that it could be more commercial and financially viable, it seems that maybe these things are secondary factors to something other, something more important. I think guests sense that.
            </p>

          <h2>Location and Direction.</h2>
          <p>
         Epic Cafe is located in Thamel ,KTM.You can find epic cafe by passing the Garden of Dreams, parked rickshaws, newly-painted zebra crossings, and when you reach Narsing Chowk, take a smart left and carry on beyond the Sandwich Point for 45 seconds (if driving) or 90 seconds (if walking). Look to your left. Next to the shell of a new building you will see a gateway with Epic Cafe emblazoned on it.
            </p>
            <br>
            
            <p>If you're looking for something affordable and comfortable, Epic is the best place to be. You can relax and enjoy at the same time whenever you visit here.The overall feeling of the place is tastefulness, soft lines, human proportions and thoughtfulness stemming from the fact that it is a home, not simply a commercial enterprise.<br><br>"Good food makes everybody happy." That's our philosophy, and we show with every meal we prepares.</p>
            <br>
           
            
            <h2>Epic Cafe is open from 6 AM to 9 PM every day except Mondays.</h2>
